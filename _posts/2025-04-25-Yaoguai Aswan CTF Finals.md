_Unfortunately, I'm not in the photo because the ceremony was delayed and I had to leave early to catch the train ðŸ˜¢_

__This write up is for the second reverse engineering challenge mainly ( stay tuned for the 3rd one ), but I'll give a quick walkthrough in the first challenge__

## First Challenge

we are given a binary and a cipher `CAS{Y6oduOh_X3_gQu3xn6t_EXF_J3vxhf_Ca_3yM7zln}`

From the main function we can see that this program simply takes an input string and encrypts it in some way ![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/1.png)

The encryption is simple

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/3.png)

it takes each character and shifts it based on if it's lower case, upper case, or a digit and left other characters untouched.

solving this can be done in many ways - I chose to simply brute force each character until I found the correct string that would produce the same cipher text

and here is the script

```python

def decrypt_char(encrypted_c):
    e = ord(encrypted_c)
    if 'a' <= encrypted_c <= 'z':
        for original in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            if (original - 97 + original % 7) % 26 + 97 == e:
                return chr(original)
    elif 'A' <= encrypted_c <= 'Z':
        for original in range(ord('A'), ord('Z') + 1):
            if (original - 65 + original % 5) % 26 + 65 == e:
                return chr(original)
    elif '0' <= encrypted_c <= '9':
        for original in range(ord('0'), ord('9') + 1):
            if (original - 45) % 10 + 48 == e:
                return chr(original)
    return encrypted_c if not encrypted_c.isalnum() else '?'

def decrypt_string(encrypted_text):
    return ''.join(decrypt_char(c) for c in encrypted_text)

enc = "CAS{Y6oduOh_X3_gQu3xn6t_EXF_J3vxhf_Ca_3yM7zln}"
print(decrypt_string(enc))
```

this will output: `BAO{W3lcoMe_T0_aNo0th3r_CTF_H0sted_By_0xL4ugh}`

a small tweak to match the flag format and here is the flag

`CAO{W3lcoMe_T0_aNo0th3r_CTF_H0sted_By_0xL4ugh}`

## Second Challenge ( 3agamesta )

### Introduction

For this challenge we are given a windows binary and a file named flag.png.encrypted

we can assume that this exe was used to encrypt the flag.png file

### First look

just executing the exe. it will ask for an argument in usage

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/4.png)

I opened the file in IDA and after some messing around, things were actually hard to identify. I couldn't tell what the program was doing until I noticed some strings like `.NET`, `.NETcore` and `dotnet`. I suspected that this was a .NET program.

Even though Detect It Easy said that it's a C/C++ compiled program and not a .NET program, that's when I thought about .NET AOT.

That's when we need to use a FLIRT signature file to rename some functions,
> You can read more about FLIRT and .NET AOT in [this article](https://harfanglab.io/insidethelab/reverse-engineering-ida-pro-aot-net/).
{: .prompt-info }

### Getting Started

once I applied the signature things became more clear

> I'm solving this challenge in a debugging session so functions names will be like 7FF..
{: .prompt-info}

Inside `__managed__Main` I go to `sub_7FF7B0BA4930` which is the actual main function of the program

> my signature file isn't perfect so there will be still missing names.
{: .prompt-warning }

anyways, after the program checks for the number of args, it will try to read the file that it was given as an argument.

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/5.png)

then that `sub_7FF7B0BA4A20` is where all the magic happens

### sub_7FF7B0BA4A20

I'll break down the function step by step

first interesting thing is this function

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/6.png)

inside, it basically calls a `RandomGeneration` function, and it was called twice, so it will generate to random numbers, one with size of 32 and the other with size of 12 (pretty interesting lengths (can assume a key and IV but let's make sure))

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/7.png)


these 2 variables will be used in this function

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/8.png)

and inside that function there is an interesting string

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/9.png)
__expand 32-byte k__

searching this string, it's actually a strong indicator for a crypto algorithms called `salsa20` or `chacha20`

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/10.png)

this algorithm typically requires 16 or 32 byte key and 8 or 12 byte IV

the next call should be the actual chacha20 encryption

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/11.png)

to confirm that, we will take the random generated key and IV in my debugging session, take the file into cyberchef and try to use the same key and IV for encryption and see if we will get the same result as the program

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/12.png)

and the program output is the same

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/13.png)

continue debugging, we see the IV value being passed from a variable to another and lastly being used in the function `sub_7FF7B0BA1C70`

this function is actually very big you can either assume what it does or ask AI :), if you choose the assumption route you can see it takes the IV as second arg, and the 3rd arg holds 0x10001 or 65537 which is pretty common value for e in RSA

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/14.png)

but to encrypt something with RSA you need the public key which consist of 2 things

- n (the modulus): A large number that is the product of two prime numbers, p and q
- e (the exponent): A number that is relatively prime to (pâˆ’1)(qâˆ’1) and is used to encrypt the message.

and of course the plaintext that will be encrypted itself

so it looks like we missed the `n`, the 4th arg, let's rewind a little bit

we can see we missed a function earlier that actually just assigns a static value for N to a variable

![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/15.png)
_RhpNewFast is a runtime helper function in .NET AOT for object allocation, and RhpAssignRefAVLocation is mostly related to array/vector memory management or allocation in .NET AOT too_

asking AI about `sub_7FF7B0BA1C70` will confirm that it's RSA related and will be used for encryption

so the IV is now RSA encrypted

let's move to the last part of the program, we see the encrypted IV being converted from large integers to a byte array in `System_Runtime_Numerics_System_Numerics_BigInteger__TryGetBytes`
![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/16.png)

and then there is one function that will be called twice

The first one takes 2 args, pointer to the encrypted file and the key
The second one takes 2 args, pointer to the encrypted file and the encrypted IV

executing both and looking at results, we see it embeds both key and encrypted IV at the end of the encrypted file __and that will be how we can actually solve this challenge!__


### Problem
now, we can get the original KEY and encrypted IV used to encrypted the flag.png file, but there is still a problem, the IV is RSA encrypted, without the private key we can't decrypt it

what private key consists of is

- n (the modulus) The same modulus used in the public key.
- d (the private exponent) A number that is the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo 
(pâˆ’1)(qâˆ’1)

in order to get the private exponent, we need to know the prime numbers p and q, but we can't because we only have the modulus n

but let's take a closer look on that n again maybe we can factorize it?

```167779367812792709915032707913032638382146251004558791142676786028501280044057627112826094280092505414510766384827088804978848108688648026981142540400168610823829003843442596437735093142183606826724002523744218048425313679193864739770021775952653310093258321014896182483000543295733022993925140727306455407233```


![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/17.png)

unknown factors but wait, the status is __P__ (prime)

There can't be a prime __n__

And this is actually a known wrong RSA implementation . With that info alone, we can calculate __d__ as follows

### Solution

```python
n = 167779367812792709915032707913032638382146251004558791142676786028501280044057627112826094280092505414510766384827088804978848108688648026981142540400168610823829003843442596437735093142183606826724002523744218048425313679193864739770021775952653310093258321014896182483000543295733022993925140727306455407233
e = 65537

phi = n-1
d = pow(e, -1, phi)

print(d)
```
```d = 34770883220674589713688057721208009132342194197841181337257367713491682340637970786676289920384155645511470299811122269088037520976077902596363550112380641045657346692732919493069838946810774797756464322100400835157431838363231012947746093977279052408359163770455161976961310085030531124456280595057391661825```

Let's get the IV from the encrypted file
![](/assets/img/posts/2025-04-25-Yaoguai%20Aswan%20CTF%20Finals/19.png)

decrypting that IV...
```python
from Crypto.Util.number import  long_to_bytes

n = 167779367812792709915032707913032638382146251004558791142676786028501280044057627112826094280092505414510766384827088804978848108688648026981142540400168610823829003843442596437735093142183606826724002523744218048425313679193864739770021775952653310093258321014896182483000543295733022993925140727306455407233
e = 65537

# take all the bytes after the 32 bytes key and it will be the encrypted IV
cipher = bytes.fromhex("80 C0 EC CF FB CF 6D 35 69 AC 35 43 FD 5D 7F 8C F9 FD 7B E3 47 84 0F 51 61 A2 F9 27 89 0F C5 07 1D AD D4 36 DE BB 34 CF 6A 4B A1 36 28 D3 F3 B6 43 41 86 C1 A8 55 FB 60 10 5B EB C3 04 B3 DD 33 C1 4D 4C E7 64 61 C4 D7 DB 7F 06 01 2A 17 F2 DE 00 51 45 59 37 08 1D AD 97 4E 99 71 12 DB BA 64 DB 27 71 2E 7B E6 29 81 9F 44 8D 92 6F 21 C5 05 52 C9 CC B9 FE EC 34 46 9B 5E 6A 1D 1C F5 CB 51")
#print(cipher)

c = int.from_bytes(cipher, 'little') # little endian because of how `System_Runtime_Numerics_System_Numerics_BigInteger__TryGetBytes` actually words

phi = n - 1  

d = pow(e, -1, phi)

m = pow(c, d, n)

print(hex(int.from_bytes(long_to_bytes(m)))[2:])
```
```IV = e0bf68e6713473f1bf3b488f```
```KEY = 5b4fa1a7ab7415c0cba40be0521a9bf5949bea22eb1fc72a05a92f6fa42d7718```

### Flag time
